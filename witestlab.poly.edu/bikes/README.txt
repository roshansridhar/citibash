Citi Bike Trip Histories

This is a set of downloadable files of Citi Bike trip data. The data includes:

* Trip Duration (seconds)
* Start Time and Date
* Stop Time and Date
* Start Station Name
* End Station Name
* Station ID
* Station Lat/Long
* Bike ID
* User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 7-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
* Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
* Year of Birth

This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any of our “test” stations (which we were using more in June and July 2013), and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

The data is from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data originally - we host it here to avoid overstressing their download servers during our workshop.
